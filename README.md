# 🛠️ Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis

This project demonstrates SQL techniques for extracting and analyzing data from a relational e-commerce database. The work includes table creation, populating sample data, and running advanced queries using MySQL.

---

## 📌 Objective

Use SQL queries to manipulate, extract, and analyze structured data from an e-commerce database using standard SQL operations.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- MySQL (compatible with PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- MySQL Workbench (for testing queries)

---

## 📋 Features and Deliverables

✅ Database schema with 4 tables:
- `customers`
- `products`
- `orders`
- `order_items`

✅ SQL Query Implementations:
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- `JOINS`: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- Subqueries (in `WHERE` and `SELECT`)
- Aggregate Functions: `SUM`, `AVG`
- Views for analytics
- Indexed columns for optimization
